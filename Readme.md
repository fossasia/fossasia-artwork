# FOSSASIA Design and Artwork

## Key Aspects of FOSSASIA's Design:

**Color Palette:** The website primarily uses a white background with "Rosso Corsa" (bright red) as an accent color. Shades of gray are also used for text and design elements. This color scheme maintains brand consistency.

**Logo:** The FOSSASIA logo, incorporating the red and white color scheme, is a critical branding element. It should be included and prominently placed in any design materials.

**Typography:** Fonts used include "Roboto" and "Rubik" or other modern sans-serif fonts like Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Open Sans, and Lato. Sans-serif fonts do not have the small projecting features known as "serifs," resulting in a clean, modern, and easily readable appearance on screens and at various sizes.

**Visuals and Images:** The website frequently features images related to open-source software, hardware projects, community events, and tech meetups. Design elements should reflect the organization's technological focus.

**Content Layout:** The FOSSASIA website uses a structured layout with clear sections for events, programs, and projects. Headers and subheaders enhance readability and navigation, providing a model for other design materials.
